This project is mean to make more elegant api endpoint using typescript classes and decorators.

This is still under heavy development.  Anything may change at any time!


Any help is very welcome. If you'd like to contribute please get in touch <cavaliere.davide@gmail.com>

Ideas:
  - define your endpoints as a class annotating it to provide configuration
  - define lambdas as methods of a class and annotate them to provide configuration
  - lambdas are automatically wrapped into a promise
  - automatic error handling
  - path and query parameters are automatically injected into the lambda
  - support for parameters validation
